                <h2>The Book</h2>
                <p class="dropcap">In "Seeing The Light While Living With Cancer," Dr. Elliott Schulman, a practicing neurologist, takes us through his personal journey with pancreatic cancer. This compassionate and heartfelt book offers unique insight into a journey of healing in a practical and personal way. The author allows the reader to experience his pathway of initial shock, depression and anger.</p>
                <p>He then creates a positive and powerful way to deal with his illness. It is a compelling journey that involves his wife Bonnie, and entire family. With the help of Bonnie and his therapist, Dr. Schulman writes about the challenges, frustrations and land mines he encounters along the way, and the tools he had to learn and put into practice in order to keep his head above the stormy sea of fear and despair.</p>
                <p>In reading this personal story of grit and love, the reader can learn about strategies he used to maintain positivity and control. He eloquently addresses the power of faith, gratitude and a daily appreciation of living life day by day.</p>
                <p>Throughout the book, his colleague and co-author, Dr. Moss Jackson, a practicing psychologist, provides a running commentary from a psychological perspective. Dr. Jackson addresses the critical challenges and skills Dr. Schulman had to learn to transform his diagnosis and illness into a powerful engagement with life. He faces adversity to learn the key lessons about living a productive life. He keenly points to the ability to move from being a passive cancer victim to being a Life Navigator.</p>
                <p>If you or a loved one has cancer and want to discover what is possible beyond accepting a path of just surviving, and instead, learning how to see the light and walk your own powerful path, this is a must read!</p>
